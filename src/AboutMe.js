    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p className="paragraph">
      I am currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year student at the University of Ottawa pursuing a double major in Electrical Engineering  and Computing Technology.
      I absolutely love trying out new things and do not mind getting my hands dirty in the process.
      I cannot resist a good challenge and will keep coming back to it until it has been finally solved.
      I learn through my mistakes, and as a result, am not afraid of making during the learning process.
      <br /> <br/>
      I have many skills, but the color theory is not my strong suit.
      As a result, I have made it possible for you to change it as you see fit.
      If you think there is a color combination that works well, feel free to email me about it and I might change that to the default color!
    </p>
